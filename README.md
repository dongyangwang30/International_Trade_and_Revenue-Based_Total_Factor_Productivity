# International_Trade_and_Revenue-Based_Total_Factor_Productivity

This is the Honors Thesis project I completed in William & Mary towards my BA in Economics. I conducted independent research and data analysis to solve my research questions. The abstract is as follows:

Economists concur that international trade is conducive to economic growth. However, at the firm level, variation exists. In this article, my goal is to conduct economic analysis on firm-level data and study the productivity effects of trade. With the comprehensive World Bank Enterprise Surveys data, I first explore trade patterns across different firms, controlling for industry, firm size, and legal status of the firm. I then conduct regression analysis to identify characteristics of firms that participate in trade. Finally, I use an instrumental variable regression to study the causal relationship between a firmâ€™s productivity and its participation in trade.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61491325/162606437-dc0b4da7-8c4b-4e39-a947-08401d5a232e.png)
